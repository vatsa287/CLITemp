# cli-weather

**cli-weather** is a command line app to get instant real-time weather data by city name or postalcode from any corner on earth right on the command line.
Written in python and powered by **WeatherBIT API**, cli-weather also provides detailed weather data, air-quality data and forecasts for next 7 days with 24 hour intervals for weather and 3 days forecast with 12 hour intervals for air-quality.

With *cli-weather app* you can retrieve current weather observations from over **45,000** live weather stations using WeatherBIT API, and highly localized weather forecasts for any point on the globe using the world's most trusted weather models such as GFS 13km, ECMWF, DWD 6.5km ICON-Europe, and NOAA 3km HRRR.!

You can look up weather data by many methods including:
- By entering city_name
- By entering postal_code

## Installation

```
pip install cli-weather
```

## Usage

> cli-weather requires [pip](pip.pypa.io) python package manager to install.
```
cli-weather command [-h] [-c COUNTRY] [-a] [-u UNITS] [-d] [-f] city_name/postal_code
```

|Command         | Description                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
|city            | Get weather by city name      |
|postalcode      | Get weather by postal code    |

|Option          | Description                   |

|-f, --forecast  | Forecast on weather/airquality|
|-c, --country   | Country of entered area       |
|-u, --units     | Metric, Scientific, Farenheit |
|-d, --detailed  | Display detailed weather data |
|-h, --help      | Show this message and exit    |

## Example

- Get current weather. Displays current temprature
```
$ cli-weather city bengaluru
```

- Get detailed current weather. Displays wide of range of weather data from snowfall to solar radiation (--detailed or -d)
```
$ cli-weather city bengaluru -d
```

- Get weather forecast for next 7 days with 24 hour interval (--forecast or -f)
```
$ cli-weather city bengaluru -f
```

- Get current air quality. Displays current Air Quality Index and its associated category (--airquality or -a)
```
$ cli-weather city bengaluru -a
```

- Get detailed current air quality. Displays concentration of various polloutants and health risk status (--detailed --airquality or -d -a)
```
$ cli-weather city bengaluru -da
```

- Get airquality forecast for next 3 days with 12 hour interval (--airquality --forecast or -a -f)
```
$ cli-weather city bengaluru -af
```

- cli-weather supports three diffrent units namely Metric(default), Scientific and Farenheit) which can be specified using --units or -u)
```
$ cli-weather city singapore -u F
```
> Displays the temprature in Farenheit

|Units           | Extensions                    |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
|M               | Celcius, m/s, mm              |
|S               | Kelvin, m/s, mm               |
|F               | F, mph, in                    |

> Note: In order to have postalcode as a mode of of input replace city with postalcode and enter known postalcode.

## Version History

**ver 0.1.5**

4 - Beta Limited Use Release
- Introduced new feature to support airquality forecast for next 3 days with 12 hours intervals when used in conjunction with -a and -f which stands for --airquality and --forecast respectively.
- Able to provide key data like aqi and its associated category,concentration of surface no2,so2,co and concentration of particulate matters.
- Introduced --version and --about to provide the version of PyPI package and description of the project.
- Almost production ready, if General API is upgraded since it does not server more than 1 simultaneous HTTPS response.

**ver 0.1.4**

3 - Alpha Test Release
- Introduced new optional argument -f, --forecast which gives 7 day weather forecast [for now will extend to airquality forecast by next release] with daily intervals from any point on the planet. The result can be fetched by either the city name or postalcode.
- Forecast data from the world's most accurate weather models including the GFS 13km, ECMWF, DWD 6.5km ICON-Europe, and NOAA 3km HRRR.
- Code reuse made for both city and postalcode by dividing functions in each class to new modules altogether.

**ver 0.1.3**

3 - Alpha Test Release
- Current Air quality observations for any point in the world.Returns current information on the six major pollutants - PM 2.5, PM 10, CO, SO2, NO2, and O3 as well as an US EPA AirQuality Index (AQI) score.
- Detailed aqi information along with its associated category and subsequent health risk status.
- Functional-Programming layout, scope for more by next release
- Set choices for units to avoid wrong units chosen
- Change in description of --detailed optional argument to accomodate new -a functionality
- Choose a subparser status during empty positional argument scenario
