## Introduction

> **cli-weather** is a command line app to get instant real-time weather data by city name or postalcode from any corner on earth right on the command line.

> Written in *python* and powered by **WeatherBIT API**, cli-weather also provides detailed weather data, air-quality data and forecasts for next 7 days with 24 hour intervals for weather and 3 days forecast with 12 hour intervals for air-quality.

> With *cli-weather app* you can retrieve current weather observations from over **45,000** live weather stations using WeatherBIT API, and highly localized weather forecasts for any point on the globe using the world's most trusted weather models such as GFS 13km, ECMWF, DWD 6.5km ICON-Europe, and NOAA 3km HRRR.!

> You can look up weather data any of the following means:
> - By entering city_name
> - By entering postal_code

4 - Beta Limited Use Release
- Introduced new feature to support airquality forecast for next 3 days with 12 hours intervals when used in conjunction with -a and -f which stands for --airquality and --forecast respectively.
- Able to provide key data like aqi and its associated category,concentration of surface no2,so2,co and concentration of particulate matters.
- Introduced --version and --about to provide the version of PyPI package and description of the project.
- Almost production ready, if General API is upgraded since it does not server more than 1 simultaneous HTTPS response.

![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyPI-v0.1.4-blue?style=plastic&logo=python&logoColor=yellow)

3 - Alpha Test Release
- Introduced new optional argument -f, --forecast which gives 7 day weather forecast [for now will extend to airquality forecast by next release] with daily intervals from any point on the planet. The result can be fetched by either the city name or postalcode.
